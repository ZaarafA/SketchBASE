Made Using: React, Firebase, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap

Major TODOs:
- Profile Subpages: Portfolio, Services
- Service Ordering System

Minor TODOs:
- Signup Validation: Check that the password fits some length/character requirement, the email isn't already in use. Show error messages to user if password is too short.
- Make Message fetch be based on an array of existing conversations. 
- Inefficiency: Message Fetching and Filtering happens on a Global level
- Make users sign up with a Username (permanent @) as well as a display name
- Make Profile pages have the url of the username rather than the UID
- Delete old avatar from Cloudinary when it's updated
- Make sure the avatar images aren't stretched
- Cloudinary Optimization: f_auto

Syling Needed:
- Replace the bell emoji in the header with a pop-up notification modal
- Signout button
- Message Page
- Search Page
